## Summary

Last week, GMX was at the center of attention by [on-chain sleuths](https://twitter.com/BatchBrewCoder/status/1605291751476002816) over inconsistent reporting of GLP price and AUM. [GMX was quick to deploy a fix which should close the price deviation](https://twitter.com/GMX_IO/status/1605387463744069632?s=20&t=IzPens1XLV3l1hklXGssFg) and the team has been pointing out that this error was not exploited for profit. 

Over Christmas, Defrost Finance (a leveraged yield trading protocol on Avalanche) got exploited for $12m. The [team says it got hacked and the attacker used flashloans to withdraw funds](https://twitter.com/Defrost_Finance/status/1606455304841236480?s=20&t=rKYo3fh4FKzd40bFqE72hg) of v2. In a separate attack, the [hacker stole owner keys for v1](https://twitter.com/Defrost_Finance/status/1606983654038974464?s=20&t=rKYo3fh4FKzd40bFqE72hg). However, security accounts like [PeckShield](https://twitter.com/peckshield/status/1606767457099993088?s=20&t=rKYo3fh4FKzd40bFqE72hg) found on-chain evidence that the team added a fake collateral token and a malicious oracle address in order to drain the pools. [Certik also suggests it is an exit scam](https://twitter.com/CertiKAlert/status/1607300101030002689?s=20&t=rKYo3fh4FKzd40bFqE72hg) and so does [DefiYieldSecurity](https://twitter.com/DefiyieldSec/status/1606805685311791104?s=20&t=rKYo3fh4FKzd40bFqE72hg).

Defrost Finance started offering a [20% bounty](https://twitter.com/Defrost_Finance/status/1606985259299790848?s=20&t=dkK9GGPXTAPmKUJzx9ti0g) for the return of the funds. In a further twist of events, Defrost has announced they [recovered the stolen v1 funds](https://twitter.com/defrost_finance/status/1607633033825247233?s=46&t=1iT-HrDxO43KOVxdgugWOA) and will implement a reimbursement plan. 

The Ankr hack that led to a major exploit of Helio Money (and depeg of $HAY stablecoin) in early December was [orchestrated by a former Ankr employee](https://twitter.com/ankrstaking/status/1605270645864013847).

## Dashboard Highlights

USDC is the dominant collateral and debt asset: 39% of all collateral and 65% of all debt is USDC. Utilization is relatively low (24%) as total collateral amounts to $5.7m vs total debt of $1.4m.

Worst day simulations show nil bad debt, as per the current risk models.

The collateral factors (CFs) for supply and borrow caps should be reviewed as current CFs are mostly higher than recommended collateral factors (except stNEAR).

DEX liquidity is relatively small for non-native assets such as ETH and WBTC.
