## Summary
The last week saw no new risk events in DeFi Lending. 

Price action of BTC & ETH continues to trend sideways as both assets have pared back recent gains.

## Dashboard Highlights

USDC is the dominant collateral and debt asset: 39% of all collateral and 52% of all debt is USDC. Utilization is relatively low as total collateral amounts to $6m vs total debt of $1.5m.

Worst day simulations show nil bad debt, as per the current risk models.

The collateral factors (CFs) for supply and borrow caps should be reviewed as current CFs are mostly higher than recommended collateral factors (except stNEAR).

DEX liquidity is relatively small for non-native assets such as ETH and WBTC.
