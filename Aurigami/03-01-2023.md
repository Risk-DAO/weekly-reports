## Summary

Avi Eisenberg, DeFi’s most prolific exploitooorr, got [arrested last week by US authorities in Puerto Rico](https://twitter.com/CoinDesk/status/1607875275227807747?s=20&t=-vZnjFCOzy9sUUpANua92w). He is charged with market manipulation over the Mango Markets exploit. The entire affidavit can be found [here](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.591629/gov.uscourts.nysd.591629.1.0.pdf) and includes details on how Avi Eisenberg operated, including KYC fraud. 

Maple Finance & Pool Delegate M11 have [distributed reimbursements in the form of $MPL token for the Orthogonal Trading default](https://twitter.com/m11credit/status/1606314452797648898?s=46&t=3s1erLeiZrwlj6HYik3Z0g). Orthogonal caused the first major credit default in the unsecured lending sector. Lenders are now holding $MPL as a form of compensation for material losses in USDC and WETH. 

Dopex, a major DeFi protocol on Arbitrum, has released a summary [blogpost on the potential of OptionFi (aka OpFi)](https://medium.com/@tztokchad/options-options-options-8adfe1eecb8c). Among the different themes, the write-up introduces put-based lending: e.g. borrowers deposit ETH collateral and buy an ETH put option for the duration of the loan. These novel types of borrowing models are interesting and we will follow developments to update the Vesta community.


## Dashboard Highlights

USDC is the dominant collateral and debt asset: 47% of all collateral and 79% of all debt is USDC. Utilization is relatively low (31%) as total collateral amounts to $6.3m vs total debt of $2m.

Worst day simulations show nil bad debt, as per the current risk models.

The collateral factors (CFs) for supply and borrow caps should be reviewed as current CFs are mostly higher than recommended collateral factors (except stNEAR).

DEX liquidity is relatively small for non-native assets such as ETH and WBTC.
