The [Euler hacker is reported to be “a regular guy”](https://thedefiant.io/euler-hacker-negotiator-interview) instead of a North Korean hacker group. The individual - nicknamed “Jacob” - was fully doxxed after a detailed investigation by Ogle, a pseudonymous, independent security researcher.

[Tier 2 stablecoins were able to capture market share from the big incumbents](https://twitter.com/TokenBrice/status/1645018754248589312?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email) (USDC, BUSD) over the last months: TUSD, USDP and LUSD were up 60%, 14% & 18% month/month, respectively. 


## Dashboard Highlights

As per RiskDAO recommendation, the Hadouken team implemented a new WBTC borrow cap at $1m. This comes as a result of significantly diminished on-chain liquidity for WBTC with very little capacity for collateral liquidations (see “DEX Liquidity” on the dashboard). RiskDAO has recommended to further reduce the caps for WBTC, ETH & BNB given limited on-chain liquidity.

Total collateral stayed at $1.6m. pCKB is the #1 collateral asset with $1m (60% of total), followed by USDC at $0.3m (19%) and USDT at $0.2m (13%). The #1 depositor accounts for 38% of all deposits. 

Total debt also remained flat at $0.4m, mostly denominated in USDC ($0.3m, 73%) and USDT ($0.1m, 24%). The largest borrower accounts for 83% of all loan volume.

Based on current usage, current liquidation thresholds are below recommended liquidation thresholds for all assets.

DEX Liquidity on Godwoken Chain has recovered from the lows seen over the last weeks. USDT DEX liquidity has normalized, closing the price oracle discrepancy that had reached 420% at its peak. DEX-prices for WBTC|eth have closed the gap with the oracle prices . All other DEX & CEX prices are in line with oracle prices.
