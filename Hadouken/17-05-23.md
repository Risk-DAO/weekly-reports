## Summary
The Ethereum beacon chain experienced a temporary issue, halting transaction finalization for roughly 25 mins. Whilst it was initially unclear what the cause is, [developers have released updates over the weekend](https://www.theblock.co/post/230723/ethereum-beacon-chain-patches-finality-issues?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss) for two Ethereum software clients, Prysm and Teku, to address the finality issue. [The Ethereum Foundation stated](https://twitter.com/superphiz/status/1657303471098404866?s=20) the problem seemed to stem from high load on some of the consensus layer clients due to an "exceptional scenario."

Aragon DAO is experiencing significant turmoil over its treasury as the association has repurposed its $177m treasury into a grants program for developers working on its software. The move was preceded by a community proposal to hand over control of the treasury to tokenholders which was initiated by 'Risk Free Value Raiders'. Aragon Association cited the [risk of a 51% governance attack](https://twitter.com/AragonProject/status/1656742220400062469?s=20) by RFV Raiders to take over the treasury. This [tweet is a detailed post-mortem](https://twitter.com/AragonProject/status/1656742212162539520?s=20) on all the events.

ParaSpace, an NFT lending protocol, is in turmoil after its CEO, Yubo Ruan, was accused of embezzlement, leading to users withdrawing over [$50 million worth of NFTs](https://twitter.com/punk9059/status/1656840705241935873?s=20). Ruan allegedly failed to return 2,909 ETH belonging to users and is suspected of distributing nearly half of these assets to unknown addresses and exchanges. The entire saga caused a “bank run” on Paraspace which [pushed APYs >90%](https://twitter.com/liquiditygoblin/status/1656640979074678784?s=20).

[MakerDAO has unveiled the 5 phases of the Endgame](https://twitter.com/MakerDAO/status/1657019717499109376) which includes: A rebrand of MKR & DAI, enable SubDAOs, build AI tools for governance, Governance Participation Rewards, and eventually build Maker’s own chain.
