## Summary

Tether wants to [deploy its profits towards BTC purchases](https://twitter.com/tether_to/status/1658805845340180480?s=46&t=dEewO-zemXyQWlz3wmtKeQ). The company will regularly allocate up to 15% of its net realized operating profits towards purchasing Bitcoin.

The MakerDAO community has [voted in GNO as a collateral asset](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmXdGdxS#vote-breakdown) on the Spark Lend protocol. GNO will be added as a strategic collateral type, facilitating a credit line to GnosisDAO, which is expected to [deepen DAI liquidity on the Gnosis Chain](https://twitter.com/MakerDAO/status/1658214705654292480?s=20). 

Ether staked has [surged by 4.4m](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2023/05/23/number-of-ether-staked-has-surged-by-44-million-since-shapella-upgrade/) since the Shapella upgrade hitting an ATH of 22.6m ETH. About [66.9k Validators have entered the queue](https://twitter.com/DefiantNews/status/1661001559189368836?s=20) with an expected waiting time of 36 days. The large demand is suspected to be ETH whales that prefer to generate passive staking yield on their holdings instead of selling their holdings in the current market environment.

In other ETH-related news, Offchain Labs [published a post-mortem on the ETH finality issue](https://offchain.medium.com/post-mortem-report-ethereum-mainnet-finality-05-11-2023-95e271dfd8b2) that occurred 2 weeks ago. The root cause of the problem was identified as certain consensus clients, including Prysm, being unable to optimally process valid attestations with an old target checkpoint. Several fixes were deployed.

The recent memecoin mania has managed to push DEX trading volumes up. In the process, the DEX-to-CEX ratio [hit a new ATH of 20%](https://www.theblock.co/post/231675/crypto-traders-flock-to-dexes-amid-memecoin-mania) as CEXes were slow to open markets in memecoins. 

Centralised exchange [Hotbit ceased all operations](https://hotbit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/14750194236823), citing a challenging market environment for crypto in general and CEXes specifically, as well as issues relating specifically to Hotbit (i.e. investigation in Summer 2022).
