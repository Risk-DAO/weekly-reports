## Summary

The Multichain protocol ($1.5bn in TVL) has been experiencing issues for five days, with stuck transactions and several cross-chain bridge pathways not yet operational (Kava, zkSync, Polygon zkEVM). The initial explanation for the problems was a system upgrade, but was later vaguely attributed to a ["force majeure"](https://twitter.com/MultichainOrg/status/1661443109019062272?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email). There are rumours that the Multichain team has been arrested in China which have not been confirmed though. As a bridging protocol, some L1s & L2s are more severely exposed to Multichain: Fantom is the most exposed with [35% of  its TVL being locked on Multichain](https://twitter.com/apes_prologue/status/1661489464798072832?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email), followed by BSC (10%) and Optimism (8%). 

MakerDAO’s core development team has [proposed to increase the DAI Savings Rate (DSR) to 3.3%](https://www.theblock.co/post/232388/makerdao-core-team-proposes-raising-dai-savings-rate) which currently stands at 1%. The idea is to bring the DSR closer to the Fed Fund Rate of 5-5.25% creating a higher native on-chain yield.

Stablecoins backed by Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs) are generating a lot of excitement in the market. Prevailing collateral is yielding ETH such as stETH, cbETH, rETH and others. New projects are emerging on a daily basis, either as new protocols or forks (eg [Tai Money is a RAI fork](https://twitter.com/taimoney6/status/1662807148101869570?s=20)). 

[Binance is launching an NFT lending platform](https://www.theblock.co/post/232178/binance-nft-loan-eth), with inaugural collections being blue-chip NFTs such as BAYC, MAYC and Azuki. LTVs range from 40-60% at interest rates of ~8%.


## Dashboard Highlights

Total collateral stayed around $1.7m. pCKB is the #1 collateral asset with $1m (57% of total), followed by USDC at $0.4m (26%) and USDT at $0.1m (9%). The #1 depositor accounts for 39% of all deposits. 

Total debt remained flat at $0.4m, mostly denominated in USDC ($0.3m, 73%) and USDT ($0.1m, 24%). The largest borrower accounts for 83% of all loan volume.

Based on current usage, current liquidation thresholds are below recommended liquidation thresholds for all assets.

DEX Liquidity on Godwoken Chain has recovered from the lows seen over the last weeks. USDT DEX liquidity has normalized, closing the price oracle discrepancy that had reached 420% at its peak. The only asset with oracle price deviation is WBTC|eth of 4.20% (DEX price). All other DEX & CEX prices are in line with oracle prices.
