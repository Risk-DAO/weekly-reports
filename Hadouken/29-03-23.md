# Summary

Last week’s headlines were dominated by the Arbitrum $ARB airdrop.

Alpha Homora’s standoff with Iron Bank continues although the AH community is making progress:  [On 21 March, AH has published the 5th Open Letter](https://twitter.com/Alpha_HomoraV2/status/1638211353734414337?s=20) proposing to commit to paying IB ~1.89M USDT and ~1.92M DAI within 1.5 years, allowing ETH and USDC depositors on Alpha Homora v2 to withdraw excess amounts proportionately (~30% for ETH and ~57% for USDC). As AH repays the debt, 63M locked ALPHA tokens will be returned from IB to Alpha treasury and distributed to affected users over time. Additionally, 20% of protocol fees from all upcoming Alpha products will be distributed to depositors over 1.5 years.

The [AH community has approved the above proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/alpha-depositors-gov.eth/proposal/0x2de064dbe527db52e20cab2bddbdab8830e4c8fee76df1c1c910d3345affbc35) and is [awaiting feedback from IB](https://twitter.com/Alpha_HomoraV2/status/1640247792160608256?s=20) to implement the code changes.

In other news, [Euler received $176m back from the hacker](https://twitter.com/DLNewsInfo/status/1640731255544135681?s=20) - out of a total of $200m stolen fund - and expects to receive the remainder as well. There’s some awkward [on-chain messaging](https://twitter.com/inversebrahfan/status/1640558858287345664?s=20) going on between the hacker and Euler:
“Jacob here. I don’t think what I say will help me in any way but I still want to say it. I fucked up,” the hacker wrote. “I didn’t want to, but I messed with others’ money, others’ jobs, others’ lives. I really fucked up. I’m sorry. I didn’t mean all that. I really didn’t fucking mean all that. Forgive me.”

Euler says they are negotiating with the hacker but it is unclear what these negotiations are about.

The regulatory side continues to hit hard with CFTC accusing Binance of operating an unregistered derivatives exchanges. Price declined in the wake of the news but recovered ever since.

USDC received support from the MakerDAO community which voted to [retain USDC as the primary reserve asset](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/03/23/stablecoin-issuer-makerdao-votes-to-retain-usdc-as-primary-reserve-even-after-depeg/).

# Dashboard Highlights

As per RiskDAO recommendation, the Hadouken team implemented a new WBTC borrow cap at $1m. This comes as a result of significantly diminished on-chain liquidity for WBTC with very little capacity for collateral liquidations (see “DEX Liquidity” on the dashboard). RiskDAO has recommended to further reduce the caps for WBTC, ETH & BNB given limited on-chain liquidity.

Total collateral increased from $1.4m to $1.7m. pCKB is the #1 collateral asset with $1.1m (67% of total), followed by USDC at $0.3m (19%) and USDT at $0.1m (8%). The #1 depositor accounts for 43% of all deposits. 

Total debt increased from $0.24m to $0.39m, mostly denominated in USDC ($0.3m, 75%) and USDT ($0.1m, 24%). The largest borrower accounts for 90% of all loan volume.

Based on current usage, current liquidation thresholds are below recommended liquidation thresholds for all assets.

DEX Liquidity on Godwoken Chain has recovered from the lows seen over the last weeks. USDT DEX liquidity has normalized, closing the price oracle discrepancy that had reached 420% at its peak. DEX & CEX prices are in line with oracle prices now.
