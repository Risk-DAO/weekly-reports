## Summary
Two weeks post-Shapella, ETH staking inflows continue to be positive: Net inflows (excl rewards) have amounted to [ETH 346,201 since Shapella](https://dune.com/hildobby/eth2-staking).

Ameen, a RAI cofounder made the headlines this week by announcing a new stablecoin [project called HAI](https://twitter.com/ameensol/status/1649097875849355265?s=20) which is a RAI fork with 3 major changes: It’s multi-collateral, involves active governance and is launching on Optimism. The project even attracted praise from [Maker co-founder Rune](https://twitter.com/RuneKek/status/1649100222952357895?s=20). 

The [Defiant published an interesting article](https://thedefiant.io/defi-projects-fail-to-recover-after-hacks) highlighting that hacked DeFi protocols rarely recover. The story finds that “a survey of the top five hacks in dollar terms shows that each protocol’s total value locked is down by at least 96% since it was hacked.” This article suggests that security is of paramount importance to protocols and cannot be understated.

HundredFinance has published a [post-mortem to last week’s hack](https://twitter.com/HundredFinance/status/1649881857389916162?s=20). The issue [applies to Compound-forks](https://twitter.com/HundredFinance/status/1647634154710769664?s=20) and is not HundredFinance specific. The protocol has been [unsuccessful in getting a response from the hacker](https://twitter.com/HundredFinance/status/1648752607563771905?s=20) and is now enlisting the services of investigators and law enforcement.


## Dashboard Highlights

As per RiskDAO recommendation, the Hadouken team implemented a new WBTC borrow cap at $1m. This comes as a result of significantly diminished on-chain liquidity for WBTC with very little capacity for collateral liquidations (see “DEX Liquidity” on the dashboard). RiskDAO has recommended to further reduce the caps for WBTC, ETH & BNB given limited on-chain liquidity.

Total collateral stayed at $1.75m. pCKB is the #1 collateral asset with $1.0m (59% of total), followed by USDC at $0.4m (21%) and USDT at $0.2m (12%). The #1 depositor accounts for 40% of all deposits. 

Total debt also remained flat at $0.4m, mostly denominated in USDC ($0.3m, 73%) and USDT ($0.1m, 24%). The largest borrower accounts for 83% of all loan volume.

Based on current usage, current liquidation thresholds are below recommended liquidation thresholds for all assets.

DEX Liquidity on Godwoken Chain has recovered from the lows seen over the last weeks. USDT DEX liquidity has normalized, closing the price oracle discrepancy that had reached 420% at its peak. DEX-prices for WBTC|eth have closed the gap with the oracle prices but still deviate by 3.6%. BNB|bsc is off by -2.1%. All other DEX & CEX prices are in line with oracle prices.
