# Weekly RiskDAO report 22 Feb ‘23

## Summary

The market has recovered materially over the last week with BTC breaking through $25k and ETH at $1.7k. The bullish market moves come against a backdrop of regulatory turbulence as the SEC is stepping up the actions against US onshore crypto platforms.

[OlympusDAO is launching a Lending AMO](https://twitter.com/OlympusDAO/status/1625515964602122240) and $OHM borrowing markets are enabled on Euler and Silo. The Lending AMO (short for Algorithmic Market Operations Controller) is an enhanced feature and will mint a maximum of Ω200k (~$2m) into these lending markets. The purpose of the AMO is to keep OHM borrow rates more attractive, scale OHM supply more strategically and optimize utility, further diversify the OHM backing. 

Platypus’ stablecoin USDP depegged on Thursday last week as the underlying protocol suffered a [flashloan exploit to the tune of $8.5m](https://www.theblock.co/post/212711/flash-loan-exploit-appears-to-be-behind-platypus-usd-stablecoin-attack). However, in a fortunate turn of events and with help from BlockSec, Platypus has been able to recover a portion of the funds (c. [USDC 2.4m](https://twitter.com/BlockSecTeam/status/1626626794966368258?s=20)). 
The attacker could only cash out $270,000 out of the almost $9.1 million in stolen funds from Platypus. As per on-chain data, approximately $8.5 million of stolen funds are frozen in the contract they were transferred to, and another $380,000 from a second attempted exploit were mistakenly sent back to Aave. Using a callback function in the attacker's contract, BlockSec helped Platypus recover a portion of the stolen funds.

## Dashboard Highlights

As per RiskDAO recommendation, the Hadouken team implemented a new WBTC borrow cap at $1m. This comes as a result of significantly diminished on-chain liquidity for WBTC with very little capacity for collateral liquidations (see “DEX Liquidity” on the dashboard).

Total collateral recovered back to $1.5m from $1.25m. pCKB is the #1 collateral asset with $0.9m (56% of total), followed by USDC at $0.4m (26%) and USDT at $0.3m (19%). The #1 depositor continues to account for 52% of all deposits. 

Total debt stayed at $0.2m, mostly denominated in USDC ($0.19m, 95%). The largest borrower accounts for 95% of all loan volume.

Based on current usage, current liquidation thresholds for all assets are below the recommended levels and thus healthy.

DEX Liquidity on Godwoken Chain has materially increased for USDT and continues to be on par with USDC. The only material oracle deviation is the DEX price for WBTC|eth at -5.7%.
