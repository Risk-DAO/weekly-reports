## Summary

BonqDAO, an overcollateralized stablecoin protocol on Polygon, [was exploited for BEUR 100m](https://mirror.xyz/bonqdaoblog.eth/hF4wGAKBG0YvMEnGTUaa0scGcQDZ8cTxtBo-RpQXRJ0). BEUR denotes BonqDAO’s EURO-pegged stablecoin. The attacker exploited BonqDAO’s implementation of the Tellor oracle and was able to artificially inflate the collateral token wALBT (AllianceBlock’s governance token). 

The attacker was able to liquidate $1.5m of BEUR for ETH and USDC with the remainder being stuck as there is no exit liquidity. It appears BonqDAOs’ faulty oracle implementation relates to [Tellor’s different price data](https://twitter.com/akshaysrivastv/status/1621024859966050305?s=20&t=WheTIc8PoSOcv3rlkohEsw): Historical prices (which are verified and checked by other validators) vs current prices (which can be reported by anyone before they are verified by other validators). BonqDAO utilized current prices which the [attacker knew to manipulate in order to inflate wALBT’s price](https://twitter.com/ThinkandDev/status/1621237501481390081).

Sperax, an overcollateralized stablecoin protocol on Arbitrum issuing $USDS, was [exploited for $300k USDS](https://twitter.com/SperaxUSD/status/1622003047688818692?s=20&t=LbDvnxP7XJb9h3YuGIzfmQ) before the attack was thwarted. In a post-mortem blog post, the Sperax team [admits to having introduced the bug in a code update in December 2022](https://twitter.com/SperaxUSD/status/1622637850083590166?s=20&t=LbDvnxP7XJb9h3YuGIzfmQ) which was missed during reviews. The hacker was identified and there are discussions about returning the stolen funds. 

[Solana-based lending protocol Everlend is shutting down](https://decrypt.co/120419/solana-based-defi-protocol-everlend-announces-shut-down). The protocol team cites missing liquidity as the main reason for not being able to offer a protocol with product-market fit.

[Avi Eisenberg waves his bail and remains in jail](https://www.dlnews.com/articles/web3/snapshot-uk-crypto-regulations-munger-ban-sbf-barred-celsius-nexo-mango-markets-eisenberg-bail/).

[Huobi is issuing $FUD “FTX User Debt” tokens](https://www.huobi.com/support/en-us/detail/94929888216783) in order to create a market in FTX’s user liabilities. [$FUD tokens are administered by DebtDAO](https://twitter.com/debtdaoio/status/1621873403249709057?s=20&t=dCyKuOJT3BXNOCtbG-EXEg) which “...hopes to help not only itself but also more creditors reclaim their rights and assets”.


## Dashboard Highlights
Total collateral stayed at $1.5m. pCKB has become the #1 collateral asset with $0.6m (38% of total), followed by USDC at $0.5m (34%) and USDT at $0.4m (28%). The #1 depositor continues to account for 36% of all deposits. 

Total debt stayed at $0.2m, mostly denominated in USDC ($0.19m, 96%). The largest borrower accounts for 95% of all loan volume.

Based on current usage, current liquidation thresholds for all assets are below the recommended levels and thus healthy.

DEX Liquidity on Godwoken Chain has materially increased for USDT and continues to be on par with USDC. There is no material oracle deviation of DEX & CEX prices.
