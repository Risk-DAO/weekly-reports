## Summary

[MakerDAO announced SparkLend](https://twitter.com/hexonaut/status/1623366011691859968?s=46&t=PrPB_EkCmYKQvyOnYCLPaw), a protocol that builds on Aave v3, is owned by Maker governance and will become one of Maker’s first SubDAOs. Spark Lend will integrate with Maker’s D3M and have a debt ceiling of 200m DAI. The launch date is expected for April 2023 and 10% of gross profit will be paid to Aave. Spark Lend also integrates with Element Finance and Sense Protocol to offer fixed rate lending.

The SEC is clamping down on staking-as-a-service operated by US exchanges which forced [Kraken to agree to a $30m settlement and shut down the service](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/02/09/kraken-agreed-to-shutter-crypto-staking-operations-to-settle-sec-charges-source/). Coinbase CEO appears more resolute to defend his stance that ETH staking is [not a security and is prepared to go to court](https://twitter.com/WatcherGuru/status/1624832181892747265?s=20&t=YCvKMHMOyRzk2DgTltDU3A).

Paxos, issuer of USDP and BUSD stablecoins, has been notified by the NYDFS to [stop minting new BUSD](https://twitter.com/PaxosGlobal/status/1625091554951004161?s=20&t=YCvKMHMOyRzk2DgTltDU3A). Paxos will service BUSD redemptions to minimize disruption. However, the news sent ripples through the stablecoin space. Paxos is also likely to be [sued by the SEC over allegations that BUSD constitutes a security](https://twitter.com/tier10k/status/1625230713275424781?s=20&t=YCvKMHMOyRzk2DgTltDU3A).

## Dashboard Highlights

As per RiskDAO recommendation, the Hadouken team implemented a new WBTC borrow cap at $1m. This comes as a result of significantly diminished on-chain liquidity for WBTC with very little capacity for collateral liquidations.

Total collateral decreased from $1.5m to $1.25m. pCKB is the #1 collateral asset with $0.6m (46% of total), followed by USDC at $0.4m (31%) and USDT at $0.3m (23%). The #1 depositor continues to account for 44% of all deposits. 

Total debt stayed at $0.2m, mostly denominated in USDC ($0.19m, 95%). The largest borrower accounts for 95% of all loan volume.

Based on current usage, current liquidation thresholds for all assets are below the recommended levels and thus healthy.

DEX Liquidity on Godwoken Chain has materially increased for USDT and continues to be on par with USDC. The only material oracle deviation is the DEX price for WBTC|eth at -5.8%.
