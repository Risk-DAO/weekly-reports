*All referenced data can be accessed directly on the [Hadouken dashboard](https://hadouken.riskdao.org/#system-status) by [RiskDAO](https://riskdao.org/).*

## Summary

The [Euler exploiter has returned all funds](https://twitter.com/eulerfinance/status/1643027386802270210?s=20) which the Euler team attributes to active negotiations and seeking a solution with the hacker. Full details are expected to become [available on 5 April](https://twitter.com/eulerfinance/status/1643027452388597765?s=20).

Do Kwon was arrested in Montenegro and is held there for the next 30 days. US and Korean authorities are trying to extradite him in order to prosecute.

Arbitrum Foundation caused a major stir among community members: The organization asked the Arbitrum DAO/community to make 750m $ARB available for operational costs. As the [vote concluded, the result was not in the interest of the Abitrum Foundation](https://twitter.com/0xedenau/status/1642502145839890432?s=20) which then ignored the outcome and replied that it was a ratification, not a request. Also, the Foundation had already spent 10m $ARB before posting the vote, much to the confusion of the community. [Arbitrum Foundation posted a lengthy forum entry](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/clarity-around-the-ratification-of-aip-1/12864) justifying their actions and rationale.

On-chain sleuths are following Binance’s crypto purchases and the CEX is down to [$113m in available capital to spend](https://twitter.com/52kskew/status/1642903392778616833?s=20).

BProtocol is [launching their new Risk Oracle for DeFi Lending markets](https://twitter.com/bprotocoleth/status/1639980458887741441?s=20) which will have automatic risk monitoring and decision-making as key features.


## Dashboard Highlights

As per RiskDAO recommendation, the Hadouken team implemented a new WBTC borrow cap at $1m. This comes as a result of significantly diminished on-chain liquidity for WBTC with very little capacity for collateral liquidations (see “DEX Liquidity” on the dashboard). RiskDAO has recommended to further reduce the caps for WBTC, ETH & BNB given limited on-chain liquidity.

Total collateral stayed at $1.7m. pCKB is the #1 collateral asset with $1.1m (64% of total), followed by USDC at $0.3m (20%) and USDT at $0.2m (10%). The #1 depositor accounts for 42% of all deposits. 

Total debt also remained flat at $0.4m, mostly denominated in USDC ($0.3m, 74%) and USDT ($0.1m, 24%). The largest borrower accounts for 88% of all loan volume.

Based on current usage, current liquidation thresholds are below recommended liquidation thresholds for all assets.

DEX Liquidity on Godwoken Chain has recovered from the lows seen over the last weeks. USDT DEX liquidity has normalized, closing the price oracle discrepancy that had reached 420% at its peak. DEX-prices for WBTC|eth deviate materially from the oracle price (5.3% difference). All other DEX & CEX prices are in line with oracle prices.
