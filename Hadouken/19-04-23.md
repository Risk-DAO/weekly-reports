## Summary
The ETH Shapella upgrade was performed successfully, turning into a “bullish unlock”. In the 48 hours following the Shapella upgrade ETH experienced a 13.1% surge, rising from $1,871 to $2,117. 

The Shapella upgrade allows users and validators to unstake through partial or full withdrawals, although a withdrawal queue prevents instant liquidation. To date, the majority of ETH has been withdrawn using the partial method, with many users choosing to re-deposit their funds.

[Borrow demand for LSDs are virtually non-existent](https://www.bankless.com/shapella-ethereum-staking-shanghai-eth): Aave’s stETH market has a utilization rate of 13%. Lenders are currently earning under 10 bps and borrowers are paying 28 bps on the protocol’s Ethereum V3 market.

FTX seems to be getting a second lifeline according to [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/technology/bankrupt-crypto-exchange-ftx-has-recovered-73-bln-assets-attorney-2023-04-12/?ref=bankless.ghost.io): FTX’s recovered funds are now valued at $7.3 billion, up from $6.2 billion since November. At the time of its collapse, FTX owed its top 50 creditors an estimated $3 billion. There’s also talk of the exchange relaunching in Q2 and the [FTX Japan auction has been canceled](https://twitter.com/AFTXcreditor/status/1645589734171852802?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email).

Lending protocol HundredFinance has been [hacked on Optimism](https://twitter.com/peckshield/status/1647307128267476992?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email) for about $7m in various tokens. The team is [publicly negotiating a 10% bounty](https://twitter.com/HundredFinance/status/1648320706243964930?s=20) if the hacker returns the funds. 

Tether blacklisted $3 million of USDT belonging to the address of a MEV bot, [due to pressure from law enforcement agencies](https://decrypt.co/125953/sandwich-ripper-mev-exploiter-joins-tethers-graveyard-blacklisted-addresses?ref=bankless.ghost.io). The MEV bot in question, called the Sandwich Exploiter, [made headlines last week](https://www.bankless.com/opensea-fights-back?ref=bankless.ghost.io) when it snagged a whopping $25.4 million from other MEV bots by exploiting a bug in the Flashbots MEV-Boost relay.


## Dashboard Highlights

As per RiskDAO recommendation, the Hadouken team implemented a new WBTC borrow cap at $1m. This comes as a result of significantly diminished on-chain liquidity for WBTC with very little capacity for collateral liquidations (see “DEX Liquidity” on the dashboard). RiskDAO has recommended to further reduce the caps for WBTC, ETH & BNB given limited on-chain liquidity.

Total collateral stayed at $1.7m. pCKB is the #1 collateral asset with $1.1m (62% of total), followed by USDC at $0.3m (17%) and USDT at $0.2m (12%). The #1 depositor accounts for 40% of all deposits. 

Total debt also remained flat at $0.4m, mostly denominated in USDC ($0.3m, 73%) and USDT ($0.1m, 24%). The largest borrower accounts for 83% of all loan volume.

Based on current usage, current liquidation thresholds are below recommended liquidation thresholds for all assets.

DEX Liquidity on Godwoken Chain has recovered from the lows seen over the last weeks. USDT DEX liquidity has normalized, closing the price oracle discrepancy that had reached 420% at its peak. DEX-prices for WBTC|eth have closed the gap with the oracle prices but still deviate by 4.4%. All other DEX & CEX prices are in line with oracle prices.
