## Summary

Both Aave & Compound have recently launched v3s on Ethereum Mainnet. Kaiko published a very interesting chart highlighting withdrawal volumes from v2 as a possible indicator of product cannibalization: So far, token withdrawals have not shown unusually high volumes.

RAI, Reflexer Labs’ ETH-backed stablecoin, received a fair amount of attention as co-founder Ameen publicly criticized the ETH-only model. [He argues that ETH staking yields introduce an opportunity cost](https://twitter.com/ameensol/status/1617582677833699330?s=20&t=7rhsli-xlkzCiG7aZaGLOw) which reduces the amount of ETH flowing into RAI. RAI was built on the ethos of decentralized collateral & governance with a certain “ETH-purity”. Ameen’s tweet triggered a a [public debate about what other collateral types RAI should accept](https://twitter.com/ameensol/status/1617981225121247232?s=20&t=r1KbAVwyo0kr1YCTsAEU1Q) (eg staked ETH) from the community and other protocol members. 

[LUSD is going multi-chain](https://twitter.com/TokenBrice/status/1617798975083679744?s=20&t=3b6dNV3EuMhBAZoQBaNwdQ) using Stargate Finance.

## Dashboard Highlights
Total collateral stayed at $1.6m after the significant jump last week. USDC remains the #1 collateral asset ($0.6m, 37% of total), followed by pCKB which increased by $0.1m to $0.6m (36%) and USDT ($0.4m, 27%). The #1 depositor continues to account for 38% of all deposits. 

Total debt increased from $0.14m to $0.2m, mostly denominated in USDC ($0.19m, 97%). The largest borrower accounts for 95% of all loan volume.

Based on current usage, current liquidation thresholds for all assets are below the recommended levels and thus healthy.

DEX Liquidity on Godwoken Chain has materially increased for USDT and is now on par with USDC. There is no material oracle deviation of DEX & CEX prices.
