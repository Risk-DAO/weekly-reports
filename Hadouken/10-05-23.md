## Summary
Memecoins are at the center of market action with coins like $PEPE whose market cap peaked at $1B market cap, generating a 4,000% return from its price just 17 days earlier (per Coingecko data). The memecoin mania also pushed Uniswap users to new highs - not seen since May 2021 - and contributed to a significant gas price spike on Ethereum Mainnet.

The memecoin mania is also spilling over onto the Bitcoin ecosystem: The recent popularity of Ordinals Inscriptions and BRC-20 transactions pushed [transaction fees on the Bitcoin chain to US$3.5 million on May 3](https://intotheblock-5494544.hs-sites.com/meme-tokens-drive-on-chain-activity-to-year-highs?ecid=ACsprvvAhw6z3qBzOJM2_YGqgD-fK7X4NHNMWvMC5bx_wRIqT8Ipdlsa29wk20Hmv_sVUth8tRQt&_hsmi=257083488), the highest since late May 2021.

Blur launched [Blend, an NFTfi protocol that offers NFT lending & Buy-Now-Pay-Later](https://twitter.com/blur_io/status/1653051809240604674?s=20). The protocol has attracted more than [ETH 50,000 in loans](https://dune.com/beetle/blur-loans).
