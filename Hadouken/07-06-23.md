## Summary

Binance has been served with a [136-page lawsuit by the SEC](https://twitter.com/collins_belton/status/1665793003393302531?s=46&t=dEewO-zemXyQWlz3wmtKeQ). The document largely claims that Binance operated an unregistered securities exchange in the US, which was backed up with leaked statements from CZ and Binance’s chief compliance officer. In the wake of the announcement, markets dumped and experienced the [highest amount of long liquidations ($320m)](https://twitter.com/CoinDesk/status/1665849756034244609?s=20) over the last three months. The lawsuit also [classifies a number of Altcoins as securities](https://twitter.com/coinvisionco/status/1665844422485983232?s=20), such as SOL, Atom, ADA, MATIC, AXS and many more. Binance published a response which criticizes the SEC’s behavior and can be found [here](https://www.binance.com/en/blog/ecosystem/sec-complaint-aims-to-unilaterally-define-crypto-market-structure-8707489117122437402). 

The Multichain saga [still has not been resolved](https://twitter.com/MultichainOrg/status/1663941611380965376?s=20): The CEO Zhaojun is missing and server access is also impossible. The affected chains for cross-chain operations are Kekchain, PublicMint, Dyno Chain, Red Light Chain, Dexit, Ekta, HPB, ONUS, Omax, Findora, Planq.

There are rumours CEX Gate.io has been impacted by the Multichain incident which [Gate.io refutes](https://twitter.com/Cointelegraph/status/1664029752615923714?s=20). ETH, BTC and stablecoin deposits on Gate.io have dropped by 14% ($124m) over a 48 hour-period late last week according to CryptoQuant. 

BKEX, another CEX, announced that some user funds on the platform were involved in money laundering activities. BKEX is currently cooperating with the authorities for evidence collection and has temporarily suspended withdrawals to facilitate the investigation.

LST-backed stablecoin project UnshETH has become the latest victim of [compromised deployer private keys](https://twitter.com/unsheth_xyz/status/1663994462740049923?s=20) which resulted in 350 stolen ETH. ETH withdrawals have been emergency paused on.
