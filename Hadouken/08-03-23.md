## Summary

Alpha Homora (AH) & Iron Bank (IB) are at a stand-off over [$32m bad debt Iron Bank](https://twitter.com/ibdotxyz/status/1631310583764242432?s=46&t=dEewO-zemXyQWlz3wmtKeQ) incurred as part of an exploit in  Feb 2021, caused by a [glitch on the part of Alpha Homora](https://www.theblock.co/linked/94809/alpha-homora-exploited-for-37-5m).

Alpha Homora was one of the first protocols to enter DAO-2-DAO protocol relationship with Iron Bank to receive undercollateralised loans. As a consequence, IB held no collateral to liquidate when the hack happened but relied on financial guarantees by AH.

To resolve the situation, both parties agreed a scheme to make Iron Bank whole: 20% of AH‘s revenue and 50m in $Alpha token as collateral. The revenue split has generated $5k in monthly revenues and the $Alpha  token price has declined significantly in price since the agreement was struck. 

It appears the situation accelerated as the $Alpha token fell significantly and in return impaired the collateral value. IB asked for the collateral to be topped off and [didn’t receive a response within a 3 day deadline](https://twitter.com/ibdotxyz/status/1631595666161160194?s=46&t=dEewO-zemXyQWlz3wmtKeQ). 

As of 1st March, Iron Bank has frozen all AH user deposits into IB to enforce a bad debt repayment. The Iron Bank team updated a contract configuration to freeze the deposits. Iron Bank is basically holding AH‘s depositors accountable to repay AH‘s DAO debts. This sets a precedent on how financial responsibility is shared between a protocol and its users towards external partners. Besides, it challenges the notion of decentralisation in DeFi.

AH is actively trying to mitigate the impact on its users through [legal means, white hat hackers and calls to Circle/Tether](https://twitter.com/alpha_homorav2/status/1632018215416250369?s=46&t=dEewO-zemXyQWlz3wmtKeQ). AH has issued a [series of Open Letters](https://blog.alphaventuredao.io) to appeal to IB and the DeFi community.

IB set a deadline of 5 March, 23:00 GMT to receive the bad debt repayment and a repayment of all AH v2 debts. IB has expressed its [discontent with AH’s latest proposal](https://twitter.com/ibdotxyz/status/1633037005113405441?t=80cpCzj51Ai9ahtDo93vYQ&s=35) and thus the situation remains fluid.


**Silvergate Bank**
Silvergate Bank, one of the largest banking partners to crypto exchanges and market makers, has [delayed its financial results for 2022](https://twitter.com/tier10k/status/1631050742566977538?s=20). The Bank indicated it might not be “going concern” as its capital base has been weakened in the wake of the crypto downturn in 2022. Unsurprisingly, markets took a beating in the wake of the announcement. Major players like [Coinbase](https://twitter.com/CoinDesk/status/1632473962792853504?s=20) and [Paxos](https://twitter.com/PaxosGlobal/status/1631294873570799617?s=20) have publicly declared immaterial exposure to  Silvergate.

## Dashboard Highlights

As per RiskDAO recommendation, the Hadouken team implemented a new WBTC borrow cap at $1m. This comes as a result of significantly diminished on-chain liquidity for WBTC with very little capacity for collateral liquidations (see “DEX Liquidity” on the dashboard). RiskDAO has recommended to further reduce the caps for WBTC, ETH & BNB given limited on-chain liquidity.

Total collateral declined from $1.5m to $1.2m. pCKB is the #1 collateral asset with $0.8m (67% of total), followed by USDC at $0.2m (19%) and USDT at $0.16m (14%). The #1 depositor continues to account for 56% of all deposits. 

Total debt stayed at $0.23m, mostly denominated in USDC ($0.2m, 84%). The largest borrower accounts for 84% of all loan volume.

Based on current usage, current liquidation thresholds for all assets are below the recommended levels and thus healthy.

DEX Liquidity on Godwoken Chain has materially increased for USDT and continues to be on par with USDC. The only material oracle deviation is the DEX price for WBTC|eth at -4.3% (this has come down significantly from -44%).
