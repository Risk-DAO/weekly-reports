# Weekly RiskDAO report 14 June ‘23
*All referenced data can be accessed directly on the [Hadouken dashboard](https://hadouken.riskdao.org/#system-status) by [RiskDAO](https://riskdao.org/).*

## Summary
Altcoins took a tumble over the weekend as Robinhood (and later eToro) ceased support for a number of Alts, incl ADA, MATIC, SOL which triggered market sales by large market makers. As a consequence, most Alts were down 20% during thin weekend liquidity.

Aave’s GHO stablecoin [launch is imminent](https://twitter.com/lemiscate/status/1666088567230324751?s=20) with the first “Facilitator” being an Ethereum pool on Aave v3. A second facilitator - called Flashminter - will allow GHO borrow and repay in the same transaction.

Stablecoin TUSD, which has recently been taking over the void left behind by BUSD on Binance, has [paused minting via Prime Trust](https://twitter.com/tusdio/status/1667386940948369408?s=46&t=dEewO-zemXyQWlz3wmtKeQ) whilst all other minting and redemption services are unaffected. 

Lending protocol Sturdy Finance has been [exploited for $800k](https://www.theblock.co/post/234102/lending-protocol-sturdy-finance-drained-of-800000-in-security-attack?utm_source=news.xml&utm_medium=rss) through a re-entrance attack. The team is [currently negotiating with the hacker](https://twitter.com/pgpsam/status/1668366929164406786?s=20) to receive all funds back for a $100k bounty.


## Dashboard Highlights

RiskDAO recommends to lower the ETH borrow cap to $1m in light of the declining liquidity on Godwoken chain.

Total collateral stayed flat at $1.6m. pCKB is the #1 collateral asset with $0.9m (56% of total), followed by USDC at $0.4m (27%) and USDT at $0.1m (9%). The #1 depositor accounts for 41% of all deposits. 

Total debt remained flat at $0.4m, mostly denominated in USDC ($0.3m, 73%) and USDT ($0.1m, 24%). The largest borrower accounts for 83% of all loan volume.

Based on current usage, current liquidation thresholds are below recommended liquidation thresholds for all assets.

DEX Liquidity on Godwoken Chain has recovered from the lows seen over the last weeks. USDT DEX liquidity has normalized, closing the price oracle discrepancy that had reached 420% at its peak. The only assets with oracle price deviation are ETH of 6.7% (DEX price) and BNB/bsc at 19.2% (DEX price). All other DEX & CEX prices are in line with oracle prices.
