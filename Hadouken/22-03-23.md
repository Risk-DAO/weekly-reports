# Summary

BTC has broken through $28k and ETH touched $1.8k over the weekend as the global financial sector continues to face significant pressures. Over the weekend, UBS agreed to buy Credit Suisse with the support of the Swiss central bank. There’s more stress in the system and macro voices are calling for QE already.

In other news, well-known crypto thinker & VC [Balaji placed a $2m bet that BTC hits $1m in the next 90 days](https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1636797265317867520).

The stand-off between Alpha Homora and Iron Bank still has not been resolved. [IB offered to individually unfreeze markets](https://twitter.com/ibdotxyz/status/1635957490226700290?s=20) but [AH declined](https://twitter.com/Alpha_HomoraV2/status/1635996673812905989?s=20) arguing this would be unfair towards users.

The Euler hackers returned about [$5.4m of stolen funds to the protocol over the weekend](https://twitter.com/BlockSecTeam/status/1636987085512142848). Addresses associated with the hacker are linked to North Korea’s Lazarus Group.



# Dashboard Highlights

As per RiskDAO recommendation, the Hadouken team implemented a new WBTC borrow cap at $1m. This comes as a result of significantly diminished on-chain liquidity for WBTC with very little capacity for collateral liquidations (see “DEX Liquidity” on the dashboard). RiskDAO has recommended to further reduce the caps for WBTC, ETH & BNB given limited on-chain liquidity.

Total collateral increased from $1.14m to $1.4m. pCKB is the #1 collateral asset with $1m (67% of total), followed by USDC at $0.4m (26%) and USDT at $0.1m (6%). The #1 depositor accounts for 55% of all deposits. 

Total debt stayed at $0.24m, mostly denominated in USDC ($0.2m, 82%). The largest borrower accounts for 82% of all loan volume.

Based on current usage, current liquidation thresholds are below recommended liquidation thresholds for all assets.

DEX Liquidity on Godwoken Chain has recovered from the lows seen over the last weeks. USDT DEX liquidity has normalized, closing the price oracle discrepancy that had reached 420% at its peak. DEX & CEX prices are in line with oracle prices now.
