# Weekly RiskDAO report 1 Mar ‘23
*All referenced data can be accessed directly on the [Hadouken dashboard](https://hadouken.riskdao.org/#system-status) by [RiskDAO](https://riskdao.org/).*

# Summary

Jump Crypto recovered [$140m from the Wormhole exploit](https://blockworks.co/news/jump-crypto-wormhole-hack-recovery). Jump together with Oasis (a MakerDAO front-end) upgraded a [contract on behalf of a court order](https://blog.oasis.app/statement-regarding-the-transactions-from-the-oasis-multisig-on-21st-feb-2023/) in order to retrieve stolen funds the exploiter deposited. This sets a precedent as it shows that upgradeable contracts can be changed by the admin key holder/MultiSigs and that court orders (or governmental intervention) can be executed in smart contracts.

In another success for law enforcement against crypto hackers, [French police arrested the Platypus hackers](https://twitter.com/Platypusdefi/status/1629448306186412033).

[Over on BSC, there was a significant BNB liquidation overhang on money market Venus](https://twitter.com/DefiIgnas/status/1628697316881481729?s=20). Had BNB crashed to $220, $200m in liquidations would have happened. Interestingly enough, the BNB ended up on Venus also as a result of another hack deposit.

# Dashboard Highlights

As per RiskDAO recommendation, the Hadouken team implemented a new WBTC borrow cap at $1m. This comes as a result of significantly diminished on-chain liquidity for WBTC with very little capacity for collateral liquidations (see “DEX Liquidity” on the dashboard). RiskDAO has recommended to further reduce the caps for WBTC, ETH & BNB given limited on-chain liquidity.

Total collateral stayed at $1.5m. pCKB is the #1 collateral asset with $0.8m (54% of total), followed by USDC at $0.4m (26%) and USDT at $0.3m (19%). The #1 depositor continues to account for 50% of all deposits. 

Total debt stayed at $0.21m, mostly denominated in USDC ($0.2m, 94%). The largest borrower accounts for 90% of all loan volume.

Based on current usage, current liquidation thresholds for all assets are below the recommended levels and thus healthy.

DEX Liquidity on Godwoken Chain has materially increased for USDT and continues to be on par with USDC. The only material oracle deviation is the DEX price for WBTC|eth at -44%.
